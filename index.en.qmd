[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) is an international community that teaches research computing lessons through workshops. The Software Carpentry JA team translates English lessons into Japanese and provides information about Software Carpentry in Japan.

Our specific goals are to translate all the [Software Carpentry lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) into Japanese, and to hold [workshops](workshops.qmd) **in Japanese** on a regular basis.

## The Translation Project

We use [Crowdin]((https://carpentries.crowdin.com/u)) for translation.

If you would like to contribute to translation, please first [create a Crowdin account](https://accounts.crowdin.com/carpentries/login), then read the [translation guide]().

### Lessons Currently in Translation

- [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry-ja.github.io/git-novice/)
- [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry-ja.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
